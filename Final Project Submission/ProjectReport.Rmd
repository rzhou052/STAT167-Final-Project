## Does time of year affect flight delays?

### Data Exploration and Visualization

```{r}
flights_clean %>%
  # get month from time_hour
  mutate(month = month(time_hour, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(month, year) %>%
  # compute average departure delay for that month
  summarise(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay), .groups = 'drop') %>% 
  # plotting departure delays by month
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = avg_dep_delay, group = year, color = factor(year))) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Seasonal Pattern of Departure Delays", x = "Month", y = "Avg Departure Delay (mins)", color = "Year") +
  theme_bw()
```

This line chart shows how departure delays vary across months for both years. Peaks in certain months could point to holiday seasons, weather events, or seasonal congestion affecting flight performance.

### Data Analysis/Modeling/Predictions

```{r, include = FALSE}
# prepare data with numeric month
flights_seasonal <- flights_clean %>%
  mutate(month = month(time_hour, label = FALSE))
```

```{r}
# constant variance: levene's test for homogeneity of variance across months
leveneTest(dep_delay ~ as.factor(month), data = flights_seasonal)

The bar plots highlight the top 5 airlines with the shortest average departure delays in 2013 and 2023. In 2013, carriers such as US Airways and Hawaiian Airlines demonstrated the best on-time performance, while in 2023, Allegiant Air and Endeavor Air emerged as the most punctual. A notable observation is the overall increase in average delays in 2023âthe most efficient airline still averaged over 6 minutes of delay, compared to just 3.7 minutes in 2013. Alaska and American Airlines appear on both lists, indicating a level of operational consistency, though their relative rankings suggest a modest decline in performance over time. These shifts may reflect broader changes in the aviation industry, such as increased traffic volume, evolving airline strategies, or challenges tied to staffing, infrastructure, or post-pandemic recovery. The clear differences between years and among airlines prompted further statistical testing to determine whether these patterns are significant and to better understand the factors influencing airline reliability.

### Data Analysis/Modeling/Predictions

data_2013 <- flights_clean %>%
  filter(year == 2013, !is.na(dep_delay)) %>%

data_2023 <- flights_clean %>%
  filter(year == 2023, !is.na(dep_delay)) %>%

  mutate(name.x = as.factor(name.x))
  
anova_2013 <- aov(dep_delay ~ name.x, data = data_2013)
anova_2023 <- aov(dep_delay ~ name.x, data = data_2023)

tukey_2013 <- TukeyHSD(anova_2013)
tukey_2023 <- TukeyHSD(anova_2023)

tukey_2023_df <- as.data.frame(tukey_2023$`name.x`) %>%
  mutate(pair = rownames(.)) %>%

```

```{r}
# flights from 2013
shapiro.test(sample(resid(anova_2013), 5000))

# flights from 2023
shapiro.test(sample(resid(anova_2023), 5000))
```

```{r}
# flights from 2013
leveneTest(dep_delay ~ name.x, data = data_2013)

# flights from 2023

```

```{r}
# flights from 2013

```

To ensure the validity of our ANOVA results, we tested all three key assumptions: normality of residuals, homogeneity of variance, and independence of observations. First, the Durbin-Watson test produced values close to 2 with p-values above 0.05, confirming that the residuals were independent. Leveneâs Test showed p-values greater than 0.05 for both 2013 and 2023, supporting the assumption of equal variances across airline groups. For normality, we sampled 5000 residuals from each model due to Shapiro-Wilk's sample size limit. Lastly, both years returned p-values below 0.05 in the Shapiro-Wilk test, indicating some deviation from normality. However, given the large sample size and the fact that Leveneâs Test confirmed homogeneity of variances, ANOVA remains robust and the results are still considered valid for this analysis. Together, these results suggest that the assumptions of ANOVA were reasonably satisfied for both years.

```{r}
summary(anova_2013)
summary(anova_2023)

tukey_2013_df
tukey_2023_df
```

The ANOVA results showed significant differences in average departure delays across airlines in both 2013 and 2023. Tukey HSD tests further revealed specific airline pairs with meaningful differences, highlighting operational disparities. As a result, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that airline performance varies meaningfully, with some airlines having significantly lower delays than others in both years.

### Results and Insights

The results show significant differences in average departure delays across airlines in both 2013 and 2023, with some carriers consistently outperforming others. Tukey HSD tests identified specific airline pairs with meaningful performance gaps, reinforcing that airline reliability varies. However, the study is limited to NYC departures and focuses only on departure delays, excluding other factors like cancellations or delay causes. Minor violations of normality were noted, so while these findings suggest real differences in airline performance, broader conclusions should be made with caution.

4.  **Is the time of the year correlated between flight delays (holidays or rainy season)?**

5.  **Which airlines have the least delays?**

    -   How has this changed over time?

Average delays increased in 2023 across the top-performing airlines, suggesting worsening punctuality industry-wide. This may be due to factors like increased air traffic, staffing shortages, or post-pandemic recovery challenges. These findings can inform consumers when choosing airlines and encourage airlines to reassess scheduling and efficiency strategies. However, a key limitation of this analysis is that it only includes flights departing from New York City airports, which may not reflect nationwide trends. Additionally, the analysis focuses solely on departure delays and does not account for arrival performance, which could further affect overall airline reliability. Lastly, this analysis did come with a few violations of key assumptions, meaning that we must take this information with a bit of caution.
